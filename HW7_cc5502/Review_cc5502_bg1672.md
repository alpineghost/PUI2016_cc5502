**CLARITY:** *is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?*

This plot is very clear: the author has plotted the average SAT math score against the average SAT reading score against the SAT writing score for each NYC school.  The title clearly communicates this, as do the axes labels.  The caption explains where the data came from and what it means.  The color (red and green) signfy averages that are above the national average.  Perhaps you could include a legend that shows what the green and red color mean? Although you include that information in the caption, putting it into the graph itself would improve the clarity of the graph as a standalone.

**ESTHETIC:** *beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?*

It is a beeutiful graph! The font size of the axes labels and axes tick values make it easy to read without being overwheming, and using the makrer size to illusrtate the the number of students taking exams seemlessly makes it more informative without overwhelming or distracting.  One thing you might want to consider is the effect of making it a 3D graph instead of a 2D.  It seems like most of the data is in one plane and it's hard to tell exatly how the data spread.  Perhaps you could make a 2D plot and compare it with the 3D to make an informed decision as to which is more informative and obscures less data (probably there are tradeoffs to each, but which one has fewer tradeoffs).

**HONESTY:** *is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?*

It doesn't appear that the graph is deforming the data to emphasize a point.  But I do think that plotting it in 2D will make it easier for a viewer to make more sophistaced inferences just by looking at the graph on their own.
