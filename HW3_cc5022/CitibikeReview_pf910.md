I suggest them to use z test since they are looking on two groups for a variable(trip duration) and also their independent variable is dichtonomous(female/male) and their dependent variable trip duration is continuous and the sample is large enough(n>30) and we can find the mean and Std from our data. Their current data set is sophisticated.
Their idea: women spend more time in each trip than men.
Null Hypo should be: the average trip duration of women is same or less than the average of men trip duration in 07/2015.
Alternative Hypo: the average trip duration of women is more than the average men trip duration in 07/2015.
